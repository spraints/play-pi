This repository is a collection of things I did to make my kids think I knew what I was doing with a raspberry pi.

To do the talking thing, get two computers (one raspberry pi, one mac).

Pi:

    sudo python talk.py 192.168.1.1 # use your mac's ip address or hostname

Mac:

    gem install sinatra
    ruby talk.rb
